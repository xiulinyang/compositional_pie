# compositional_pie
In this project, I propose to use the surprisal differential between the initial token and the last token of the V-N Potential Idiom Expressions to measure their compositionality.

# Instructions
- Create a virtual environment (python=3.8) and install all dependencies.
- To replicate my experiments with the bigram model, please contact me and I will send you the KenML bigram model file.
- To replicate the experiments with GPT2, just run gpt2.py
